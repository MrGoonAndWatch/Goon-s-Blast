# Goon's Blast

Goon's Blast is a 3D Online PvP and PvE party game made in the spirit of retro games from the late 90's made in Unity utilizing the PUN 2 framework by a single developer.

Most of the dev work has been (and will continue to be) streamed on my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/mr_goonandwatch) , with the VODs all archived on [my YouTube VOD channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyx6nvVeAF4&list=PLyC5C5slUbM5iXDfiD2rFdnQhz6a-DAoD&index=1)

# Download the game

An alpha build of the game has been released on ([itch.io here:](https://mrgoonandwatch.itch.io/goons-blast-alpha))

This is very much out of date with the latest code in this repo but will be updated as I reach certain milestones in development.
